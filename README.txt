Pass this document from each person to the next. Add to it as necessary, especially the section below where the STORY is described.



=== RULES ===

The basic idea for the story of the station is that each of us is acquiring it from the previous owner who is under some kind of duress, or after a failed venture. Any silly reason will do. Come up with some kind of reason you wanted to, or needed to, buy or somehow acquire the station from them.

A running gag was started that the station's wiring is not up to code and is causing all kinds of trouble from one user to the next. If would be funny to incorporate that into your video and keep the gag going. Bob never finished the wiring. He sold to Chickenkeeper who had signage and lighting issues. Chicenkeeper never tried to fix the wiring before passing it to Scott, and so on. Basically we don't expect it to ever get better!

Each of us should include a one-minute or less video explaining why you're giving up the station. Provide this video to the person who gets the station next. When you get the station, include their short clip in YOUR video, and explain either before or after that clip why you then acquired it from them. This will link us all together.

Use the Videos/Intro.MP4 at the start of your video to give the entire series a cohesive look.

Don’t delete anyone’s module, but you can rearrange things as necessary.

Use 50 or less parts because it’ll still be 400+ parts by the end if each person uses all 50 allotted.

You may weld, but of course include your new PART file(s) in the included GameData folder.

Before transferring the necessary files to the next person, make sure to delete anything they don't need, such as the videos from the person before you and outdated save files. You can either submit a pull request, or just give a ZIP back to Bob and he'll update the git repo for you.

Ideally it would be best to aim to get your video finished within around 7-10 days of recieving this file.

After you're done, send Bob the link to your video so it can be added to the playlist:

=== THE STORY ===
Bob Fitch was going to offer exclusive access to the station as a vacation spot or whatever his backers wanted to do with it, but then some crowd funding dried up and he was forced to sell the station. The wiring was incomplete, but the sale to ChickenKeeper was “as is” so the maintenance problems were his to deal with next.

ChickenKeeper bought the station from Bob because he was looking for a new business opportunity, and realised he had a chance of making money by mining the ore from the asteroid, converting it, then selling fuel to ships passing by Kerbin. Unfortunately space is a pretty empty place, and a lack of customers mixed with very limited resources in the asteroid forced the fuel station to be sold at a loss. He still didn't get that wiring finished either.

Manley bought the station to make an ultra exclusive dining establishment with amazing views, however reviewers declared that the venue lacked atmosphere, and by operating it as an restaurant it became subject to ADA regulations which meant it was supposed to be wheelchair accessible. The substandard wiring wasn't up for running the extra hardware and the station was sold to pay off creditors.
